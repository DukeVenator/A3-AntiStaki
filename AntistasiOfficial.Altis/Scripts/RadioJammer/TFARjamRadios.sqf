/*
Jam Radios script for TFAR created by Asherion and Rebel
Version 0.2.0
Available from: https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/203810-release-radio-jamming-script-for-task-force-radio/

This script will jam radios for all players within a given radius of a jamming vehicle
Jamming is stronger nearer to the vehicle, while less strong at the edges of the radius
NOTE: It is recommended to call this script from initPlayerLocal.sqf if you want to run the script from mission start.

Parameter(s):
0: ARRAY of object(s) (Required)- Entity(s) that will cause the radios to be jammed.
1: NUMBER (Optional)- Range of the jammer in Meters. Default is 1000.
2: NUMBER (Optional)- Strength of the jammer. Default is 50.
3: BOOL (Optional)- Enable Debug. Default is False.
Example: jamRadios = [[JAMMER],500] execVM "TFARjamRadios.sqf";
